# Top K Frequent Elements
## Description

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order. 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
