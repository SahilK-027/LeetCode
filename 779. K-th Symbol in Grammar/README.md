# Determine if String Halves Are Alike
## Description

We build a table of n rows (1-indexed). We start by writing 0 in the 1st row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of 0 with 01, and each occurrence of 1 with 10.

- For example, for n = 3, the 1st row is 0, the 2nd row is 01, and the 3rd row is 0110.
Given two integer n and k, return the kth (1-indexed) symbol in the nth row of a table of n rows.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: row 1: 0
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 2, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: 
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
```
