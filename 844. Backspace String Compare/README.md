# Backspace String Compare
## Description

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.
 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
```
