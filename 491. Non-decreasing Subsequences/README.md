# Non-decreasing Subsequences
## Description

Given an integer array nums, return all the different possible non-decreasing subsequences of the given array with at least two elements. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,6,7,7]
Output: [[4,6],[4,6,7],[4,6,7,7],[4,7],[4,7,7],[6,7],[6,7,7],[7,7]]
```

Example 2:

```
