## Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
 
Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

Example 2:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
