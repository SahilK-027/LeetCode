# Two Sum
## Description

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```
Example 3:
```

Output: false
```
